#### Meaning of the name?

💧 **Mizu** (**Water** from japanese). Machine learning is all about **adaptability** and **fluidity**. Our framework is designed to **smoothly** adapt to different datasets and tasks, much like **water** effortlessly flows and adapts to its environment.

🌀 **Quruma** (**Wheel** from japanese). Just as a wheel **keeps turning** and **moving forward**, our framework is dynamic and constantly **evolving**. It symbolizes our commitment to staying at the forefront of machine learning advancements and always **progressing**

📊 **Introducing the First Module**

The initial component of my comprehensive framework is a **linear regression** model. What sets this project apart is its emphasis on delivering a deep understanding at the **foundational level**, delving into the mathematical intricacies beneath the surface. As a result, you'll discover comprehensive documentation that encompasses both the mathematical and programming aspects.
